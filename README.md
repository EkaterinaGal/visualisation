Visualisation Project

This dashboard is an effective tool for a PR manager to identify (1) the most risky Industries and (2) their Media Coverage (Publishers).
Graph 1 - Identifies the industries with the most negative average sentiment.  
Graph 2 - Regions or countries where articles with negative sentiment originated. 
Graph 3 - Cumulative contribution to % of total to drill on the most harmful publishers. 
Graph 4 - Cycle graph of mean sentiment distrubution, providing a guide of where the 'Normal' is.
The dashboard is actionable as it allows to proactively address potentially risky publishers  to minimise the possibility of future negative sentiment.
